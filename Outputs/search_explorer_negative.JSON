Selling cheaply doesn't make us subject to eating anything, especially the quality of the pizzas, which also leave a lot to be desired. Just because I pay a dollar at a bar doesn't mean I have to eat only onions anyway. Just because the pizza costs 14.99 doesn't mean the dough has to be thin and the toppings scarce. More care is needed because those who purchase their products are human beings. Stop for a moment and take stock of yourself.
